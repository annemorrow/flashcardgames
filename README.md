# FlashCard Games

## Backend

A CRUD app where users can make lists and then fill lists with question and answer pairs.  Lists belong to users, and questions belong to lists.  At this time, questions are expected to belong to a single list and lists to a single user.  However, I intend to make it easy to download/upload csv files so that many questions can be added at once, and I intend that users should be able to move questions between lists.

## Frontend

Different games which use question lists.  These games might include jeopardy, timed flashcards, etc.
